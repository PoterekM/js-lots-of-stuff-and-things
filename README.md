## Step 1
### Set up project with necessary JavaScript, jQuery, and HTML

## Step 2
### Split JavaScript into business logic and UI logic
_This will entail linking the files by using Node modules with the special keyword called `exports`_
* create js folder
  * move UI logic into js/pingpong-interface.js
  * be sure to include extra script tag for interface file so browser has access to both
