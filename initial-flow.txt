Let's trace through the flow. We start with the back-end file that we are pulling into our front-end file. The program travels in this direction because we couldn't use our Calculator without declaring it first. We have created a constructor function called Calculator. We have attached a method to it called pingPong in the usual way. Then we attach the whole Calculator declaration to a property on the exports global object called calculatorModule.

Then, in the front-end file, we pull in everything attached to exports by using require('./../js/pingpong.js'). Next, we specify which property of exports we are interested in by saying require('./../js/pingpong.js').calculatorModule. Since we stored Calculator in the calculatorModule property, it is pulled out using dot notation and stored in a new variable that we also call Calculator. This line is what allows us to instantiate the new Calculator object below and store it in a variable called simpleCalculator. Finally, we can call our pingPong method on our simpleCalculator object, and store the result inside of another variable called output. Then we can do whatever we want in the browser using good old fashioned jQuery.
